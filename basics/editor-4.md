#### Key Features and Functionalities

1. **User Role Validation:**
   * The page checks if the logged-in user is an admin or a manager. If not, the user is redirected to the login page. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive loan data.
2. **Dynamic Sidebar:**
   * Based on the user's role (admin or manager), the appropriate sidebar is included, offering relevant navigation options and functionalities specific to their roles.
3. **Loan Data Retrieval:**
   * The application queries the daabase to fetch loan records, which are ordered by creation date. This gives a chronological view of loans, enabling easy tracking of recent activities.
4. **Officer Identification:**
   * For each loan, the page identifies the officer responsible for onboarding the loan. If the officer is not an admin, their name is retrieved from the `managers` table based on their email address. This enhances transparency by clearly showing which officer managed each loan.
5. **Detailed Loan Information:**
   * The table includes essential details for each loan:
     * **Officer Name**: The name of the officer managing the loan, which helps in accountability.
     * **Loan Number**: A unique identifier for each loan.
     * **Loan Principal**: The initial amount borrowed, providing insights into the size of loans being handled.
     * **Loan Balance**: The remaining amount owed on each loan, critical for assessing current liabilities.
     * **Received Payments**: Total payments made towards the loan, helping to track repayment progress.
6. **User-Friendly Table:**
   * The data is presented in a well-structured table format, which is responsive and allows for easy navigation and data analysis. The table can accommodate sorting and filtering functionalities, enhancing usability.
7. **Export Functionality:**
   * The page provides options to export the data (potentially as CSV, PDF, etc.), facilitating offline analysis and reporting.

#### Benefits to the User

* **Enhanced Oversight**: Admins can easily monitor the performance of different onboarding officers and assess how well they manage loans.
* **Data-Driven Decisions**: Access to detailed reports allows administrators to make informed decisions based on the loan performance metrics displayed on the page.
* **Accountability**: By displaying officer names alongside their respective loans, the system promotes accountability and encourages officers to manage their assigned loans effectively.
* **Improved Client Service**: By analyzing loan reports, the admin can identify patterns or issues in loan management, leading to better service and support for clients.

Overall, the **Officers' Reports for Admin** page is a valuable tool that streamlines the management of loans and enhances oversight within the organization.
