#### How to Apply for a Loan

1. **Access the Loan Application Page**\
   Ensure you are logged in as an admin or manager/loan officer. If not logged in, navigate to the login page and use your credentials to access your dashboard.
2. **Search for the Client**
   * Enter the **National ID** of the client in the provided form field.
   * Click the **Search** button.
   * If the client does not exist in the system, you will be prompted to onboard or register the client first.
3. **Fill in Loan Details**\
   Once the client is found:
   * **Requested Amount**: Enter the loan amount the client is applying for.
   * **Loan Purpose**: State the purpose of the loan (e.g., business expansion, education).
   * **Duration**: Enter the loan repayment period (e.g., 12 months).
   * **Duration Period**: Specify the period unit, such as "months" or "years."
   * **Collateral Name and Value**: Provide details of the collateral (if applicable), including its name and estimated value.
4. **Upload Required Documents**\
   Attach the following documents:
   * **Collateral Photos**: Upload two images of the collateral (file types allowed: jpg, jpeg, png). Ensure the file size is less than 10MB.
   * **Signed Application Form**: Upload the signed loan application form in an image format (file types allowed: jpg, jpeg, png). Ensure the file size is less than 10MB.
5. **Submit Loan Application**\
   After filling in all required details and attaching the necessary documents:
   * Click the **Submit** button to complete the application process.
   * A confirmation message will display, and an email will be sent to the client informing them of their loan status as "Pending."
6. **Notifications and Approval**
   * The system will notify the client via email and add a notification to their dashboard that their loan application has been submitted and is awaiting approval.
   * The admin and managers will also receive notifications prompting them to review and approve the loan.

The loan will only be approved after an authorized administrator verifies and approves the application.
